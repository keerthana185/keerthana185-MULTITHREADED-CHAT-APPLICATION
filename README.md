##This Java-based server-client application facilitates real-time text communication between multiple clients over a network. The server listens for incoming client connections on a specified port and manages them using separate threads for concurrent communication. Each client connects to the server, sends their name, and can exchange messages with others. The server receives messages from one client and broadcasts them to all connected clients except the sender. This setup demonstrates the use of Java sockets, multithreading, and basic I/O streams for building a simple chat system, highlighting core concepts of network programming and concurrent client handling in Java.
